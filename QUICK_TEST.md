# 🎲 READY TO TEST - Quick Commands

## ✅ What Was Fixed

Your YOLO11s model outputs `[1, 10, 8400]` which contains:
- **Rows 0-3:** Bounding boxes (x, y, w, h)
- **Rows 4-9:** Class scores (6 dice faces)

**The code now correctly extracts BOTH!**

**Update:** Code consolidated to use ONE model file (`die_classifier.tflite`) for both detection and classification.

---

## 🗑️ Remove Duplicate Model (Optional)

```bash
# Run the batch script to delete die_detection.tflite
.\DELETE_DUPLICATE_MODEL.bat
```

Or manually:
```bash
del app\src\main\assets\die_detection.tflite
```

**Result:** Only `die_classifier.tflite` remains (used for both tasks)

---

## 🚀 Build & Test Commands

```bash
cd C:\Users\disne\AndroidStudioProjects\DiceEyeApp
.\gradlew.bat clean assembleDebug
```

Then install and test with 6 dice.

---

## 🔍 Verify in Logcat

```bash
adb logcat | grep DiceDetector
```

**Should see:**
```
DiceDetector: YOLO11 transposed: 10 outputs (4 bbox + 6 classes), 8400 predictions
DiceDetector: Processing 6 raw detections from model output
DiceDetector: 6 detections remaining after NMS
```

**NOT:**
```
DiceDetector: 0 detections remaining after NMS  ← Old problem
```

---

## 📊 Expected Results

- **Detection:** 5-6/6 dice found (83-100%)
- **Classification:** 4-5/6 correct (67-83%)
- **Overall:** 70-85% accuracy

---

## 🎯 One Model System

YOLO11s does BOTH:
1. Detects locations (rows 0-3)
2. Classifies faces (rows 4-9)

**No re-export needed - just rebuild and test!** 🎉
