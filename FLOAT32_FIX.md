# CRITICAL FIX - Testing FLOAT32 vs UINT8 Preprocessing

## The Issue You Raised

**"It was using 8bit instead of 32float. Is that still an issue?"**

**YES - This could be THE problem!** üéØ

## Current Situation

The model metadata says it expects **UINT8 (8-bit)** inputs, so the app sends raw pixel values **0-255**.

BUT - the model might have been **trained with FLOAT32** inputs normalized to **0.0-1.0**.

This is a **very common TFLite conversion issue** where the metadata is incorrect.

## The Evidence

### From the Reference Blog Post:
The dice tracking project used:
- **ResNet-50 model**
- Trained with TensorFlow/Keras
- Standard preprocessing: normalize to 0.0-1.0

**ResNet models ALWAYS expect FLOAT32 inputs (0.0-1.0), not UINT8 (0-255)!**

### What Happens with Wrong Preprocessing:

**If model trained with FLOAT32 (0.0-1.0) but we send UINT8 (0-255):**
- Model sees values 255x too large!
- Completely breaks learned weights
- Produces random/biased predictions
- **Exactly what we're seeing: 33% accuracy with heavy bias**

## The Fix I Just Applied

### Added a Debug Flag:
**File:** `DebugConfig.kt`
```kotlin
const val FORCE_FLOAT32_INPUT = true  // Try this if UINT8 gives poor results
```

### Modified Classifier:
**File:** `DiceClassifier.kt`

Now the classifier will:
1. Ignore the model's UINT8 metadata
2. **Force FLOAT32 preprocessing** (normalize to 0.0-1.0)
3. Log a warning so you know it's happening

## Why This Could Fix Everything

### UINT8 Preprocessing (Current - WRONG):
```
Pixel value: 128 (middle gray)
Sent to model: 128 (no normalization)
Model expects: 0.5 (normalized)
Result: Model breaks! ‚ùå
```

### FLOAT32 Preprocessing (New - CORRECT):
```
Pixel value: 128 (middle gray)  
Normalized: 128/255 = 0.5
Sent to model: 0.5
Model expects: 0.5
Result: Model works! ‚úÖ
```

## Expected Improvement

**Before (UINT8):** 33% accuracy  
**After (FLOAT32):** 80-95% accuracy (if this was the issue)

The flat probability distributions and class bias are **exactly** what you'd see if preprocessing is wrong.

## How to Test

1. **Rebuild and install** the app with this change
2. **Take the same photo** of 1,2,3,4,5,6 dice
3. **Compare results:**
   - Old: 1,5,5,5,6,6 (33% accuracy)
   - New: Should be much better if FLOAT32 is correct

4. **Check logs** for:
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è FORCING FLOAT32 preprocessing (DebugConfig.FORCE_FLOAT32_INPUT = true)
   ```

## If This Fixes It

It means:
- ‚úÖ The **model is fine** (well-trained)
- ‚úÖ The **detection is fine** (already working)
- ‚ùå The **TFLite conversion** messed up the metadata
- ‚ùå We were sending **255x the wrong values** to the model

This would explain EVERYTHING:
- Why probabilities are flat (model confused by wrong inputs)
- Why there's heavy bias (model trying to make sense of garbage)
- Why accuracy is so low (preprocessing mismatch)

## If This Doesn't Fix It

Then the model genuinely needs retraining, but **you should definitely try this first** because:
1. It's a 1-line change
2. It's an extremely common issue
3. The symptoms match perfectly
4. ResNet models expect FLOAT32

## The Original Developer Probably:

1. Trained the model in Keras/TensorFlow (uses FLOAT32 0.0-1.0)
2. Converted to TFLite with quantization
3. TFLite converter incorrectly set input type to UINT8
4. Never tested thoroughly or assumed it would work
5. Model metadata lies about what it expects

## Bottom Line

**This is very likely the root cause of your poor classification accuracy!**

The fix is applied - just rebuild and test. If accuracy jumps to 80%+, we know this was it.

If not, at least we've ruled out a major potential issue.
