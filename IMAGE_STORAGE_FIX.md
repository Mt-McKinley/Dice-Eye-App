# Image Storage Fix Applied

## The Problem
Images were not appearing in Windows File Explorer at `This PC\SAMSUNG-SM-G935A\Phone\Pictures\DiceEyeDebug`

## Root Causes Found
1. **Missing Storage Permission Request** - App was only asking for CAMERA permission, not WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
2. **No Media Scanning** - Even when files were written, Windows MTP didn't see them immediately
3. **Silent Failures** - If write failed, there was no fallback

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Storage Permission Request
**File:** `GameScreen.kt`
- Now requests `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission on app startup
- This is required on Android 6.0+ to write to public directories

### 2. Enhanced File Saving with Fallback
**File:** `DebugBitmap.kt`
- **Primary:** Tries to save to `/storage/emulated/0/Pictures/DiceEyeDebug/` (PUBLIC - visible in Windows)
- **Fallback:** If primary fails, saves to `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.example.dice_eye_app/files/Pictures/DiceEyeDebug/` (APP-SPECIFIC)
- Verifies file was actually written (checks `file.exists()` and `file.length() > 0`)
- Better error logging with ✅/❌ indicators

### 3. Added Media Scanner
**File:** `DebugBitmap.kt`
- Calls `MediaScannerConnection.scanFile()` after saving
- This makes files **immediately visible** in Windows MTP and Gallery
- Without this, files might not appear until phone restarts or you manually refresh

## Where Images Will Be Saved

### Primary Location (Visible in Windows):
```
Windows: This PC\SAMSUNG-SM-G935A\Phone\Pictures\DiceEyeDebug
Android: /storage/emulated/0/Pictures/DiceEyeDebug/
```

### Fallback Location (If primary fails):
```
Android: /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.example.dice_eye_app/files/Pictures/DiceEyeDebug/
```
⚠️ Note: Fallback location requires using a file manager app on the phone - not directly visible via Windows MTP

## How to Test

1. **Rebuild and install** the app
2. **When app starts**, you'll see a permission dialog for "Allow Dice Eye App to access photos and media?"
3. **Tap "Allow"**
4. **Take a photo** of dice
5. **Check logcat** for these messages:
   ```
   ✅ SAVED TO PUBLIC PICTURES: /storage/emulated/0/Pictures/DiceEyeDebug/20251027_XXXXXX_original_rotated.jpg (725KB)
   ```
6. **In Windows**, go to `This PC\SAMSUNG-SM-G935A\Phone\Pictures\DiceEyeDebug`
7. **Refresh** the folder (F5) - you should see the images!

## If Images Still Don't Appear

Check logcat for these error patterns:

### Pattern 1: Permission Denied
```
❌ File not created or empty
Failed to save to public Pictures, trying app-specific storage
✅ SAVED TO APP-SPECIFIC
```
**Solution:** Make sure you granted storage permission

### Pattern 2: Directory Creation Failed
```
Created directory: /storage/emulated/0/Pictures/DiceEyeDebug, success=false
```
**Solution:** Storage might be full or corrupted

### Pattern 3: Both Failed
```
❌ FAILED BOTH LOCATIONS
```
**Solution:** Serious issue - check if phone storage is working

## Quick Permission Check

If you're not sure if permission was granted:
1. Go to phone **Settings** > **Apps** > **Dice Eye App** > **Permissions**
2. Make sure **Storage** (or **Files and media**) is set to **Allow**

## Files You'll See

When it works, you'll see timestamped files like:
- `20251027_214036_278_original_rotated.jpg` - Original captured image
- `20251027_214038_371_crop_0.jpg` - Individual cropped dice
- `20251027_214044_397_final_overlay.jpg` - Final result with labels

All visible in both:
- Windows File Explorer
- Phone Gallery app
