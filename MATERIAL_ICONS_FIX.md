# Material Icons Dependency Added ‚úÖ

## What I Fixed

I added the missing **Material Icons Extended** library to your `build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
implementation("androidx.compose.material:material-icons-extended:1.7.5")
```

This library provides all the Material Design icons used in your `GameScreen.kt`:
- `Icons.AutoMirrored.Filled.ArrowBack`
- `Icons.Default.AddCircle`
- `Icons.Default.Refresh`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: You Must Sync Gradle Now!

The error `Unresolved reference 'icons'` will persist until you sync your Gradle project to download the new dependency.

### How to Sync Gradle:

**Option 1: Android Studio**
1. Look for the notification banner at the top of the editor that says "Gradle files have changed"
2. Click **"Sync Now"**

**Option 2: Manual Sync**
1. Click on **File** ‚Üí **Sync Project with Gradle Files**
2. Or click the elephant icon with a downward arrow in the toolbar

**Option 3: Command Line**
```cmd
cd C:\Users\disne\AndroidStudioProjects\DiceEyeApp
gradlew.bat --refresh-dependencies
```

### After Syncing

Once Gradle sync completes:
1. ‚úÖ The `Icons` imports will be resolved
2. ‚úÖ Your `GameScreen.kt` will compile without errors
3. ‚úÖ All the icon references will work properly

The library is version **1.7.5** which matches your Compose BOM version (2025.10.00), ensuring compatibility.
