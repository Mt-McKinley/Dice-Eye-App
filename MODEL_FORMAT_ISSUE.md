# ‚õî CRITICAL: YOLO Model Format Incompatible with Detection

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Status:** ‚ùå BLOCKER - Cannot proceed with current model

---

## üö® The Core Problem

Your YOLO11s model exports in the **wrong format** for object detection!

### Your Model Output:
```
Shape: [1, 10, 8400]
Format: [batch, classes, predictions]
Contains: Only class probability scores
```

### Required for Detection:
```
Shape: [1, 8400, 84]  (or [1, 8400, 10] for 6-class model)
Format: [batch, predictions, features]
Contains: Bounding box coords (x,y,w,h) + class scores
```

---

## üîç Why This Happened

When you exported your YOLO11s model, it exported in **classification mode**, not **detection mode**.

The Ultralytics export probably used:
```python
# This exports for classification (wrong):
model.export(format='tflite', task='classify')

# Should have been (correct):
model.export(format='tflite', task='detect')
```

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: Re-export the Model Correctly

### Step 1: Go Back to Your Export Environment
```bash
cd C:\Users\disne\Downloads\d6Training\my_model
```

### Step 2: Re-export with Correct Settings
```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO('my_model.pt')

# Export for DETECTION (not classification!)
model.export(
    format='tflite',
    imgsz=640,
    int8=False
)
```

This should create a model with output shape `[1, 8400, 10]` or `[1, 8400, 84]`.

---

## üîç How to Verify the Export

After exporting, check the output shape:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the model
interpreter = tf.lite.Interpreter(model_path='my_model.tflite')
interpreter.allocate_tensors()

# Check output details
output_details = interpreter.get_output_details()
print(f"Output shape: {output_details[0]['shape']}")
```

**Expected:**
```
Output shape: [1, 8400, 10]  ‚Üê CORRECT (predictions, features)
```

**NOT:**
```
Output shape: [1, 10, 8400]  ‚Üê WRONG (classes, predictions)
```

---

## üéØ Alternative: Use Old Detection Model + New Classifier

If re-exporting is difficult, you can:

1. **Keep the old detection model** (`die_detection.tflite` - the one that gave you 2/6 dice)
2. **Use YOLO11s for classification only** (`die_classifier.tflite`)

This is a **true two-stage approach**:
- Stage 1: Old model detects dice locations
- Stage 2: YOLO11s classifies each die

### Revert Detection Model:
```bash
cd C:\Users\disne\AndroidStudioProjects\DiceEyeApp\app\src\main\assets

# Restore backup if you have it
copy die_detection.tflite.backup die_detection.tflite
```

**Performance:**
- Detection: 2/6 dice (poor but functional)
- Classification: Should work well with YOLO11s

---

## üîß Quick Fix (Temporary)

If you want to test right now without re-exporting:

### Option 1: Use Git to Restore Old Detection Model
```bash
cd C:\Users\disne\AndroidStudioProjects\DiceEyeApp
git checkout app/src/main/assets/die_detection.tflite
```

### Option 2: Lower Detection Confidence
The old model might detect more dice with lower threshold:

**Edit `DiceDetector.kt`:**
```kotlin
const val CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.05f  // Lower from 0.15
```

---

## üìä Current Status

| Component | Model | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Detection** | YOLO11s [1,10,8400] | ‚ùå Wrong format |
| **Classification** | YOLO11s [1,10,8400] | ‚úÖ Working |

**Result:** 0 dice detected (model can't extract bounding boxes)

---

## üéØ Recommended Actions

### Best Option: Re-export Model Correctly
1. Go back to Python/Anaconda
2. Load `my_model.pt`
3. Export with `task='detect'` (not classify)
4. Verify output shape is `[1, 8400, N]`
5. Replace both model files

### Quick Option: Revert Detection Model
1. Restore old `die_detection.tflite`
2. Keep YOLO11s for classification only
3. Accept 2/6 detection rate for now
4. Focus on improving classification

---

## üö® Why You Can't Use [1, 10, 8400] for Detection

This format contains:
- **10 float arrays of length 8400**
- Each array = confidence scores for one class across all grid cells
- **NO x, y, width, height coordinates!**

Detection requires:
- **8400 predictions**
- Each prediction = [x, y, w, h, class0_score, class1_score, ...]
- **Bounding box coordinates are essential!**

---

## üìù Summary

Your YOLO11s model is a **classification model**, not a **detection model**.

**You need to either:**
1. Re-export the model correctly for detection, OR
2. Use the old detection model + YOLO11s for classification

The current model **cannot detect** dice locations because it doesn't output bounding boxes.

**Status:** Blocked until model is re-exported or old detection model is restored.
